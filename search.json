    "text": "> Read the Official NHS Guidance\n\nCore NHS colours\n\n\n\n\nNHS Blue\n#005EB8\n\n\nWhite\n#FFFFFF\n\n\n\n\nThe core NHS Blue and white are supported by four other groups of colours in the NHS colour palette, to provide NHS organisations with the flexibility to differentiate their communications from each other, but not from the NHS.\n\n\nLevel 1: NHS blues\n\n\n\n\nNHS Dark Blue\n#003087\n\n\nNHS Bright Blue\n#0072CE\n\n\nNHS Light Blue\n#41B6E6\n\n\nNHS Aqua Blue\n#00A9CE\n\n\n\n\nThis is the top level palette that reinforces people’s association with blue and white. There are a number of hues to support the main NHS Blue colour to give lighter and darker alternatives to add tonal variety.\n\n\nLevel 2: NHS neutrals\n\n\n\n\nNHS Black\n#231f20\n\n\nNHS Dark Grey\n#425563\n\n\nNHS Mid Grey\n#768692\n\n\nNHS Pale grey\n#E8EDEE\n\n\n\n\nThese colours help to support the top level blues. Black and dark grey can be used for type, depending on the background and application. The lighter greys can be used as backgrounds when they are appropriate and are useful online colours. White is, of course, the most important neutral base. These colours will support the overall blue and white look if they are used with the proper emphasis.\n\n\nLevel 3: NHS support greens\n\n\n\n\nNHS Dark Green\n#006747\n\n\nNHS Green\n#009639\n\n\nNHS Light Green\n#78BE20\n\n\nNHS Aqua Green\n#00A499\n\n\n\n\nGreen is close to blue in the colour spectrum and gives a feel of being in the same colour family. Therefore, when they are used moderately and in a secondary support role, they will not compromise the strong associations people have with blue and white. However, if it becomes too dominant it will impact on people’s ability to instantly recognise the NHS as being the source of the information.\n\n\nLevel 4: NHS highlights\n\n\n\n\nNHS Purple\n#003087\n\n\nDark Pink\n#7C2855\n\n\nNHS Pink\n#AE2573\n\n\nNHS Dark Red\n#8A1538\n\n\nEmergency Services Red\n#DA291C\n\n\nNHS Orange\n#ED8B00\n\n\nNHS Warm Yellow\n#FFB81C\n\n\nNHS Yellow\n#FAE100\n\n\n\n\nHighlights are very useful for drawing attention to details, helping to warm up the blue look and providing accent colours to enable NHS organisations, partnerships and services to differentiate themselves from each other. However, they should not be used too heavily otherwise they change the overall look dramatically and people will not associate your communication with the NHS. Therefore, use minimally and do not use large blocks of these highlight colours.\nThe highlight colour ‘Emergency Services Red’ is not exclusively for use in relation to emergency and urgent care services. However, because of its strong association and use in this area, you should carefully consider how you use it for other purposes."

And it extends in several ways: all features are possible beyond R too, including Python and Javascript. It also has more “guardrails”: accessibility and inclusion are centered in the design. Quarto is for people who love R-Markdown, and it’s for people who have never used RMarkdown.\nQuarto.org is the go-to place for full documentation and more tutorials!"
